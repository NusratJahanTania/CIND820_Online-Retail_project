# CIND820_Online-Retail_project
The sale of goods and services over the internet is known as online retailing. In online retail, a business or individual sells retail products and services through online stores. Online retailers can increase their sales and profits faster than an offline shop as selling online offers the advantage of having an open store, twenty-four hours a day or seven days in a week. This advantage allows online retailers to expand their market globally or target an extremely focused groups. To gain profit in online retailing, it is important to set business strategies focusing customer buying attitude along with the sales’ trends. To achieve this, I chose an online retailing dataset to analyze the existing retailing trends and predict the future. In this project I aim to perform exploratory analysis on ‘Online Retail’ data set and visualize different aspects. I also target to do a RFM analysis along with applying clustering and classification algorithms to segment the customers in different clusters and predict the future retailing trends of each customer cluster.
